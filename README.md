# bootdev-project1-blockbreaker_game
this is a personal project to create a pygame based game like the classic breakout game.


# Basic outline of project.
This is a python project based on the pygame package. 

This is loosly based on the classic breakout game with a "paddle" at the bottom of the screen that the player controls with the arrow keys. 

In the top half of the "screen" there will be a series of rows of blocks that need to be broken up.

To break the blocks there is a "ball" that the player bounces off the paddle to the blocks. if the paddle is moving sideways it induces hoizontal velocity to the ball.

If the ball hits the top or sides of the screen it will rebound in the same way as light off a mirror.

each block will take a number of hits to break, each layer will take more hits than the previous one. the colour of the blocks will reflect the remaining number of hits to break it.
